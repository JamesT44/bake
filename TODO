* check build and source tool versions from bakeconf.xml
* compressed 'bake' binary
* add <patch> xml node in source node.
* export env vars that need to be modified in shell from build objects
* find a way to deal with per-module options that are not build-tool-dependent

* missing commands:
  - diff in ModuleSource
  - reset in ModuleSource
  - clean in ModuleSource
  - query modules, deps, etc.
